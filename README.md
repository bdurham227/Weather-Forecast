## 1. Description
​
Life can be busy! So here's a solution. Plan your day-to-day schedule to keep on top of a busy work schedule with the Work Day Scheduler application. Here you can input and update your current day-to-day needs without worrying if you have a pen in your or a pen in your pocket. Simply type into your schedule and organize your day-to-day, hour-by-hour schedule. The application will change colors to let you know if you a meeting has passed, what you currently have going on and what's left in your daily schedule.
