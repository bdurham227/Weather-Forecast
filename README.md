<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description
​
The acceptance criteria was to create a weather dashboard application that displayed the current weather of a city that a user searches for. My weather dashboard displays the city name, the current date of search, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the uv-index. Below you will find the five day forecast so you can address appropriately.
